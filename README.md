# lab-Naive-Bayes-Classifier
In this lab, we tried to analyze the dataset with the help of R programming language, we file with messages and some info about then being spam or not. So, we tried to implement a class, which has to us whether those messages were "correct". We built fit method in our class to represent the updated dataframe for further analysis. After that we implemented predict message, which calculates the probability of being fake or not.
And the last method shows the accuracy of our probability calculator.
